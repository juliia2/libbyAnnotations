Welcome to Libby Annotations (name TBD). <br>
If you are familiar with the ebook app, Libby, you may be familiar with their highlight and notes functions. Creating the highlights is super easy, but it's a bit tricky to go through all of these after you've finished your book. 
<br>So, my app idea is to simplify viewing these annotations, especially in filtering. 
<br><br>
It'll start simple, with just importing a csv file or similar and displaying it. Then I'd like to add features to filter your highlights/notes, search them, add multiple books.... etc. More to be added here as I go! ðŸ“‘
